### ðŸš§ Setting up my homelab

My homelab journey started with virtual machines (VMs) loaded onto an external hard drive (SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD 1TB). Here I was able to have a play with Kali and a few different versions of Windows.

I moved onto a 2017 iMac that had been gifted to me by a family member. I have a neat Apple A1048 keyboard I found from a business that was moving.

I set up Ubuntu on the iMac. This involved using balenaEtcher to create a bootable USB drive. It's pretty cool to bring a 2017 iMac back to life with a fresh operating system. For my hypervisor I have opted for Oracle VirtualBox. I like the VirtualBox UI and it's pretty easy to get the hang of.

My current set up is a mini lab. I had a clear idea of what I wanted it to look like and what I wanted to achieve - a physically small setup, a space for my lab which was separate from the other devices in the house with VLANs. VLANs are virtual ports that sit on top of the switchâ€™s physical ports. They let you connect devices to separate networks. I used draw.io to mock it up and asked for feedback in the pilar discord group. I got great feedback on how to set up a temporary, low cost lab. Using a travel router to piggy back on my existing ASUS router. I bought a Netgear GS108E 8 port managed switch, two tiny Lenovo M910q desktop PCs and a few CAT 6 ethernet cables.

Building a homelab stayed on my To Do list for quite a while. It was a bit daunting to get started. Some of the homelabs on reddit.com/r/homelab are huge. A buddy pointed me toward [Serve The Home's Project TinyMiniMicro Home Lab Revolution](https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/). I also found reddit.com/r/minilab/ which was useful to see what others had made. I had to stop scrolling and start. Knowing what to start with was tricky. How do I use a switch to get VLANs set up? I started with setting up the GL.iNet Slate AX 1800 travel router. I use the repeater method. I also set up VPN through the travel routerâ€™s admin panel. Next was the switch. It wasnâ€™t all that scary setting up VLANs. A few YouTube videos, reading and re-reading the Netgear documentation. I configured VLANs on the switch and via LuCl, OpenWrt for the router. Now I have two separate networks to use for my tech playground.

The mini lab took about one week to set up. I was determined to get it set up and not get too distracted or despondent when things didnâ€™t come together the first time. It was on my To Do list for too long and needed to just get done. Itâ€™s been great to â€˜raise the barâ€™ of my home network. But also get a win to build my confidence with doing something pretty technical.
